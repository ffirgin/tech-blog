## Description

PROJECT IS IN DEVELOPMENT.

(Will be resubmitting this homework, as I'm not comfortable with all the topics to fully grasp all of the concepts. README will be updated with better information and all current information is placeholder.)

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions coming soon.

npm i express-handlebars mysql2 sequelize dotenv bcrypt express-session connect-session-sequelize

## Usage

Usage will be updated once project is finished at a later time.

## Credits

No collaborators or credits to give at this time.
